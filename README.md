# Clone_UsabilityHub_Homepage.github.io
This is a clone of homepage of a website UsabilityHub.com, which is a remote user research platform that takes the guesswork out of design decisions by validating them with real users. I tried to replicate this website to get command on important concepts of HTML and CSS.
